  <h1>Hello and Welcome!</h1>
  <p>I'm using this space as a personal knowledge hub, primarily to share my learnings and discoveries in the world of ServiceNow. If you're looking for practical scripts, troubleshooting tips, or just want to see how I tackle various ServiceNow challenges, you're in the right place.</p>
  <p>Beyond ServiceNow, I'm a bit of a "nerd stuff" enthusiast, so you might stumble upon other tech-related explorations and projects here. Feel free to browse around and see what catches your eye!</p>
